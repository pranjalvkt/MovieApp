1-- for username --> use "new@gmail.com" or create new one using sign-up page
2-- for password--> use "admin" (always)
3-- for any changes to be reflected in dashboard --> first navigate to home and then go back to dashboard
4-- sorting is only done in home page
5- please run the "MovieServer" as well (maybe post will be different on your machine, so just have a look)
6-- Only username is being taken in signup, because admin is taken password by default
7-- After signup, move to login page, it will not be redirected automatically
